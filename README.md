# Kaggle-Titanic-Competition
This repository holds my submitted code for Kaggle's competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"

About: 
Shortly, the challenge was to create a machine learning based model that will be able to predict which passengers survived the Titanic Shipwreck.

My model managed to predict the Survival status of the 418 passengers specified with an accuracy of 76.55% 
The NoteBook contains my code along with detailed description of each step I have made.
